# cpu_scheduling
How to run it in Ubuntu

Step 1: Install Python (if not installed)
First, check if Python is already installed. Open the terminal and type:

python3 --version

If Python 3 is installed, it will display the version number. If not, you can install Python using the following command:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3

Step 2: Save the Script to a File

Open a text editor (like nano or gedit) in your terminal to create the Python script file.
For example, use nano to create and edit the script:

nano cpu_scheduling.py

Paste your script (the code you provided) into the text editor.
Save the file by pressing CTRL + O (to write the file), then press Enter. Exit by pressing CTRL + X.

Step 3: Run the Script
Now that the script is saved, you can run it using Python 3.

In the terminal, run:

python3 cpu_scheduling.py
